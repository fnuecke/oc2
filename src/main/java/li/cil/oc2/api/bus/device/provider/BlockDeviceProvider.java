/**
 * This is used to query for devices given a block face.
 * <p>
 * Implementations <em>may</em> return various device types depending on the query.
 * <p>
 * For identical queries and world state, implementations <em>should</em> return the same device.
 * Failing that, implementations <em>should</em> return instances that are equal to each other
 * when compared using {@link Object#equals(Object)} and have equal {@link Object#hashCode()}s.
 * <p>
 * This allows avoiding unnecessary re-initialization of devices that have not changed since a
 * previous scan.
 * <p>
 * This is also required to avoid device duplication when a device is connected to a
 * {@link li.cil.oc2.api.bus.DeviceBus} more than once. An example where this can occur are
 * blocks that expose the same device on all sides having connected cabling adjacent to more
 * than one face.
 * <p>
 * Providers can be registered via the provider registries, much like blocks and items
 * are registered. For example:
 * <pre>
 * class YourModInitialization {
 *     static DeferredRegister&lt;BlockDeviceProvider&gt; BLOCK_DEVICE_PROVIDERS = DeferredRegister.create(BlockDeviceProvider.REGISTRY, "your_mod_id");
 *
 *     static void initialize() {
 *         BLOCK_DEVICE_PROVIDERS.register("your_block_device_name", YourBlockDeviceProvider::new);
 *
 *         BLOCK_DEVICE_PROVIDERS.register(FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus());
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>

 * @see li.cil.oc2.api.bus.device.rpc.RPCDevice
