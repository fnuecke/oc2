# Bus Interface
![Plug and play](item:oc2:bus_interface)

Bus interfaces connect external devices to [computers](computer.md). This includes explicit device blocks, such as the [redstone interface](redstone_interface.md). Some generic functionality blocks of blocks is also available, such as information on energy storage.

It is possible to configure an explicit name for a bus interface using a [wrench](../item/wrench.md). This is useful when attaching multiple devices of the same type to a computer: when searching devices by type name (`devices:find(typeName)`), these custom names will also work.
 
Note that [computers](computer.md) must also be explicitly connected to a [bus](bus_cable.md) with a bus connector.
