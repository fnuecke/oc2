# Computer
![1 + 1 = 10](block:oc2:computer)

Computers provide a basis for building hardware capable of running an operating system or low-level software.

Read the [quickstart guide](../getting_started.md) for a short explanation on how to get a working computer.

### Configuration
Configure the components in a computer in its inventory screen. To access this screen, either open the computer with a [wrench](../item/wrench.md), or switch to the inventory screen using the toggle button to the left of the terminal screen.

### Connectivity
To connect external devices to a computer, use [bus interfaces](bus_interface.md) and [bus cables](bus_cable.md). Note that computers must be explicitly connected to a bus with a bus interface.

### Energy
Usually, computers will require energy to run. Most modern energy generators producing RF energy should be compatible. Computers have a small built-in energy storage. However, this will usually not be sufficient to keep the machine running for any prolonged amount of time.
