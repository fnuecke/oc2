# Keyboard
![To click or not to click](block:oc2:keyboard)

The keyboard allows key presses to be picked up by [computers](computer.md). Its primary use-case is in combination with a [projector](projector.md), when using a Linux system.

When using the default Linux distribution, this device will provide events via the `evdev` system. To use its input this without additional configuration, use a [projector](projector.md). The keyboard input will be sent to the terminal session displayed there.

Note that the only face of the keyboard device large enough to fit a bus interface is at the bottom. Keyboards may be placed anywhere, as long as they're connected to the computer via a bus.

To start typing on a keyboard, simply interact with it. Experienced typists will find they do not need to look at the keys while typing (you can still look around while using the keyboard). Interact again to stop using the keyboard.

Computers *have to be shut down* before installing or removing this component. Installing it while the computer is running will have no effect, removing it may lead to system errors.
