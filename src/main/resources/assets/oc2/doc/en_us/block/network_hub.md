# Network Hub
![One to five](block:oc2:network_hub)

The network hub connects multiple [network connectors](network_connector.md) with each other. It forwards any packet arriving at any attached connector to all other attached connectors. This forwarding operation will consume one hop, reducing the packet's time to live.
