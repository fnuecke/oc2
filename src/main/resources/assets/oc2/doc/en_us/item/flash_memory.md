# Flash Memory
![Not that Flash](item:oc2:flash_memory)

Flash memory contains the initial code loaded into a [computer's](../block/computer.md) memory upon boot. This typically at least includes the firmware for the system. The default firmware provided with new computers and [robots](robot.md) also contains a Linux kernel. This kernel expects a root filesystem to be present on the first [hard drive](hard_drive.md) in the system.
