# Floppy
![It's not the floppy that bends](item:oc2:floppy)

Floppy disks are removable media. This means they can be inserted and removed from [disk drives](../block/disk_drive.md) without the [computer](../block/disk_drive.md) using the disk drive having to reboot to use them.

Please see the [disk drive](../block/disk_drive.md) manual entry for some useful commands when working with floppies.
