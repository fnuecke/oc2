# Hard Drive
![Going in circles](item:oc2:hard_drive_large)

Hard drives are the main storage device used for data storage in [computers](../block/computer.md) and [robots](robot.md).

Usually computers use a firmware that requires some hard drive to complete the boot process. The [flash memory](flash_memory.md) installed in newly obtained computers and robots contains a Linux distribution expecting a regular root file system on the first installed disk drive. One may typically be obtained by configuring a hard drive with the [appropriate tool](wrench.md).

Computers *have to be shut down* before installing or removing this component. Installing it while the computer is running will have no effect, removing it may lead to system errors.
