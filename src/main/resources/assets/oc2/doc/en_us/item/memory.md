The random access memory (RAM) device provides working memory to [computers](../block/computer.md) and [robots](robot.md).

As opposed to [hard drives](hard_drive.md), this memory is volatile and will be cleared when a computer powers down. It is theoretically possible for computers to function without RAM, by software only using the stack for data storage. However, typically software requires RAM to function. In particular, the [firmware](flash_memory.md) contained in newly obtained computers requires a decent amount to function.

Also see the [getting started](../getting_started.md) manual entry.

Computers *have to be shut down* before installing or removing this component. Installing it while the computer is running will have no effect, removing it may lead to system errors.
