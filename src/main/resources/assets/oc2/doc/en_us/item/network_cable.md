# Network Cable
![What the CAT!?](item:oc2:network_cable)

Network cables connect pairs of [network connectors](../block/network_connector.md). This makes it possible to conveniently bridge large distances. To place a network cable, use it on the two network connectors to connect, one after the other.

Cables have a maximum length. It may be necessary to use network connectors as repeaters to increase the effective range of network cables.
